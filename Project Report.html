### About the Visualization

Topic: Correlation between Covid-19 fatality rates and Blood Type A.
<br>
Libraries used: D3 library and Jquery for Java Script
<br>

<h1>Project Essay:</h1><br><br>

<h2>Question</h2> Are Covid-19 patients with specific blood types at higher risk of mortality?

<h2>Messaging:</h2>
Covid-19 patients with blood Type A+ and A- have higher mortality rates.

<h2>Martini Narrative structure</h2>:
<br>The visualization follows Martini structure.

<h3>Author-driven content</h3>:
<ol>Question:<br> Are Covid-19 patients with specific blood types at higher risk of mortality? </ol>
<ol>Article:<br> There is an article that introduces user to the established facts about associations between blood types and various diseases. Different research source articles are also provided to support this argumenet.</ol>
<ol>Observations:<br> The observations about different blood types and their Covid-19 mortality rates are expressed next to the visualizations. Also, the fact that European coutries have higher A blood types is stated.</ol>

<br><br>Further, the default state of the scatter plot if Fatality rates on y axis and blood type A+ on the x-axis. This supports the author driven content to support the message.

<h3>Jumping point:</h3> <br>
Once the user completes going through the article, the user has 3 combinations of options amongst the given 2 visualizations to explore further. Structurally, the article and initial states of the visualizations support
Author driven content before user can explore further.

<h3>Reader-driven content:</h3><br>
<ol>Highlighting:<br> Countries are colored coded by their continents along with legends for the continents. This shows that European countries have higher mortality rates. The next visualization(bar chart) can be used to pick European countries and find out their blood type distributions</ol>
<ol>Filtering:<br>
  Scatter plot:<br> User can select amongst 12 data points on x and y axis to filter different visulizations.<br>
  Bar chart:<br> User can find out blood type distribution by country.
</ol>
<ol>Path-choosing:<br>
  User can start with 2 paths. 1st the scatter plot enables the user to find out correlations between blood types, fatality rates, confirmed cases, population. User can also choose the 2nd path to use the bar chart to find out countries and their blood type distributions.
</ol>

<h3>Visual Structure:</h3><br>
<ol>Structure:<br> The content of the visulization is laid out top down to support Martini narrative structure. The user first gets a message and then realizes that there are buttons and drop downs against the visulizations that he can use to explore various paths.
  The drop down and button controls and the colors are chosen to intrigue user to play with the data.
</ol>
<ol>Highlighting:<br> The background to the visuliaztion and the colors are chosen to highlight the visualization</ol>
<ol>Transition<br> The colors of both the visualizations are chosen in similar tone. Further the colors to the scatter plot bubbles(countries) are color coded by continent. The overall text content has the white background and uniform dark font style and size.</ol>

<h3>Scenes:</h3><br>
The author driven content is a single scene. And then user can click various drop down values amongst the 2 visuliaztions to get different scenes.

<h3>Annotations:</h3><br>
The color legends for the continents are annotations to help identify the correlation between European countries, their high blood type A distributions and resulting high fatality rates.
Futher, tool tips are provided on teh scatter plot to annotate to the user about the data points.

<h3>Parameters:</h3><br>
Scatterplot has two paramters- x-axis and y-axis values. There are 12 values in each drop down. These parameters show on the axis scales depending on their logorithmic denotations.
<br> Bar chart has a single paramter Countries to choose filter blood type distribution for the selected county. The percentage of the blood type distribution show on x-axis and, the blood types show on the x-axis.
<h3>Triggers:</h3><br>
On page load, the content is set to show the author driven content. <br>
The drop down values on the scatter plot can be selected and the Submit button can be clicked to trigger
to plot the selected values on axes and scatter plot accordingly.<br>
The drop down values on the bar chart show countries. As a user clicks on a country name from the drop down, the chart is rendered accordingly.
